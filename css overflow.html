    <div><b>From the best of times to the worst of times, it is rightly said that there's nothing more beautiful and
            rewarding than true friendship in the world. Whether you have a single friend you call your best friend or a
            group of friends you cannot do without meeting every week, friendships are undoubtedly special, and lighten
            you
            up on the dullest of days, toughest of times and make a lively moment even happier and brighter. That's how
            friends are. From an early age, friendships teach us a lot about life and support. As they say, they
            definitely
            are the extended family we choose.Most of all, like any relationship, they also require love, nurturing and
            care
            and that's why, to honour this very special bond, we have a very special day every year, Friendship's Day.
            Celebrated every first Sunday in the month of August, Friendship Day is celebrated with a lot of joy. This
            year,
            it shall be celebrated on August 1.</b> </div> <video src=" C:\Users\nirma\Downloads\pexels-artem-podrez-6943517.mp4" height="200px" width="200px" controls></video><br>
