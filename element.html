<body><p>Friendship is a relationship of mutual affection between people.
    It is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an "acquaintance" or an "association", 
    such as a classmate, neighbor, coworker, or colleague.</p>
    <h2>Good friends are vitally important to your mental health and to the quality of your life. To live and to love are inseparable from each other. 
        Friendship is an opportunity to love, to learn about yourself, to mature as a human being, and to open up to the full experience of life.</h2>
